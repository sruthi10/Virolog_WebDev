First, run 'main.py' to download all of the webpages from an online journal. See 'crawler.py' for information about the arguments to pass.


Then, run 'analyze.py' to get the counts of the number or articles each protein is mentioned in.


Here are arguments which you should pass to the crawler to crawl some open access journals:

PLOS Genetics. (Other PLOS journals are similar):
net_locs = ['journals.plos.org']
paths = ['/plosgenetics/volume', '/plosgenetics/issue', '/plosgenetics/article']
seeds = ['http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/volume']

MDPI Viruses
net_locs = ['www.mdpi.com']
paths = ['/journal/viruses', '/1999-4915', '/1999-4915/[0-9]+/[0-9]+/[0-9]+', '/1999-4915/[0-9]+/[0-9]+', '/1999-4915/[0-9]+', '/1999-4915/[0-9]+/[0-9]+/[0-9]+/htm']
seeds = ['http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/1']

mBio ASM:
net_locs = ['mbio.asm.org']
paths = ['/content/by/year/[0-9]+', '/content/[0-9]+/[0-9]+/.*']
seeds = ['http://mbio.asm.org/content/by/year']
